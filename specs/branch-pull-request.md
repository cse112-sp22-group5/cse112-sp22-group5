## Branching
*Feel free to use the source control is VSCode instead of the terminal*

Before adding and committing changes,
1. If a branch has not been created for the feature you are currently working on, create a branch.
    
        git branch <name of feature> 

2. Switch to that branch
   
        git checkout <branch>

3. Add and commit relevant files with a message detailing the changes you made.

        git add <files>
        git commit -m "<commit message>"

4. Push the branch to the remote repo

        git push -u origin <branch>

5. Go to github.com. There should be a message at the top that asks if you want to create a pull request. Click create pull request.
6.
