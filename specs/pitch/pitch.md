## The Problem
Problem: yada yada
ADRs

## The Appetite
The reality of our team's situation is that we have a limited 10 weeks to create a Pomodoro application, with about five of those weeks spent on technical development. Therefore, we must narrow our application's focus to, foremost, developing a functioning Pomodoro timer that can be intuitively understood by a user.

While our user stories show a desire for a product that can increase productivity and focus, we must not stray away from the main purpose of our application: a Pomodoro timer. Something else?

## Our Solution: Productoro

We began our brainstorming by considering the user stories and then creating fat marker sketches:

From these sketches, we decided...

Next, we narrowed down the elements we brainstormed by creating wireframes:

![Beyond MVP tasks](/specs/interface/wireframes/beyond-mvp-tasks.jpg)

Finally, we developed a high fidelity prototype to visualize our timer's intended functionality: [view here](https://www.figma.com/proto/t4hjtf1Mjf2cT3ixRSMBpV/Pomodoro-Timer?node-id=16%3A14&scaling=min-zoom)
