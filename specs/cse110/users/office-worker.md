## User story:
As someone who doesn't use technology very often and is unfamiliar with it, I would like the timer to be simple and easy to use and maybe have some sort of instructions on how to use it. Also, as a parent working from home, I may need to stop working in the middle of a pomo to take care of my kids so it would be great to be able to reset a pomo in those cases.
