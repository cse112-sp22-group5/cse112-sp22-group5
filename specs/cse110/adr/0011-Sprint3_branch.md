## Context and Problem Statement
Created a new branch to make integration easier  

## Decision Outcome
- At the end of our second sprint, we had a lot of trouble with integration as all of code was divided into feature branches that weren't merged togerther. So for sprint 3, we decided to make a new branch called Sprint3 to make pull requests to and to test the code on before merging to master.
