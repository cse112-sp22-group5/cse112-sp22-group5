## Context and Problem Statement

How do we want to implement tasks? Should we implement tasks?

## Considered Options

* side bar that retracts when user doesn't need it
* have tasks at bottom of screen so user can scroll down to see it
* can check off tasks
* keep track of how many pomos per task
* don't save info (number of pomos per task)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options:
* collapsible task list
* can add tasks and descriptions (optional)
* check them off during break when they finish them
* can drag tasks to reorder them

because tasks aren't as important as the timer itself so they are optional for the user to use but they aren't tied to the timer or the pomos

Tasks will be implemented sprint 4
