## Context and Problem Statement

We want to have a plan for our MVP. What basic features do we want on our Pomodoro Timer?

## Considered Options

* time aspects
  * start
  * stop = stops timer and ends progress for the day
  * reset = restarts the current pomo
* notifications
  * audio buzzer
    * one for pomo end
    * one for break end
  * banner notifications
* default number of pomos for the day
* visual counter for pomos completed so far (for the day)
* static explanation of pomodoro
* keyboard shortcuts
* user profile
* tasks
* incentives (assign points for each pomo)
* customizeable time limits

## Decision Outcome

Chosen features:
* time aspects
  * start
  * stop = stops timer and ends progress for the day
  * reset = restarts the current pomo
* notifications
  * audio buzzer
    * one for pomo end
    * one for break end
  * banner notifications
* default number of pomos for the day
* visual counter for pomos completed so far (for the day)
* static explanation of pomodoro

because 
* We felt that these were the very basic features required for the correct functionality of the Pomodoro Timer
* We want to focus on a reasonable amount features that we believe that we can finish in the time frame of the first sprint
