## Context and Problem Statement

What keys do we want to use to implement keyboard shortcuts

## Considered Options

- Use s for start and r for reset
- Use a single key to make it more user friendly

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options:

- We decided to use the spacebar as the only shorcut since at any given time, only one of the buttons (start/reset) will be enabled. This will also make for a more user friendly experience.
