# Pull Requests

- Status: accepted
- Deciders: Nidhi Giridhar, Sydney Wong, Jasmine Chen, Alejandro Malanche, Alejandro Marquez, Ian Rebmann, Zachary Chan, Samuel Burkholder
- Date: Sprint 2

## Context and Problem Statement

Using pull requests and assigning a person to review and merge changes.

## Decision Outcome

- For sprint 2, we did not make use of pull requests which made it very hard to integrate the code together at the end. So for sprint 3, we decided that every time we get a component working, we will make a pull request to the sprint3 branch and Nidhi will review it, resolve any conflicts, and merge the branch into Sprint3.
