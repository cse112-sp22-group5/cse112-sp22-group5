## User story:

As a professor, I would like to use the pomo timer during class and have students stand up and stretch throughout a long lecture. I probably won't be looking at the timer while teaching so having an audible alarm once a pomo is over would be helpful. The timer should be simple and intuitive to use since I am not very good with technology. Instructions on how to use it would be nice. It may also be helpful to adjust the length of the pomos as I may want a break only every 1 hour.
