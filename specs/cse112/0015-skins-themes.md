# Skins / Themes 
- Status: Completed

## Context and Problem Statement
Users have aesthetic preferences such as dark mode lovers or background image lovers. Additionally, some users are color blind and may not be able to use our pomodoro timer due to conflicting colors.

## Considered Options
- Color Palette themes
- Background Images 

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option(s):
- Dark Mode, Light Mode, and Default Mode 
- 4 basic background images 
- Color Blind Mode 
- None changing background color on dark and light mode

We decided to have a seperate color scheme specifically for color blind individuals and believed dark, light, and default were enough themes to maintain the minimal feel of the application.
For those concerned about background images, there are some default images to choose from and an includable link to your own image.
