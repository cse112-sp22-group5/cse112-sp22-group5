All Cypress tests can be found at [<code>./cypress/integration/Productoro-Tests/UI-test.js</code>](./cypress/integration/Productoro-Tests/UI-test.js).

## Tech/framework used
Productoro is developed using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Babel-Jest and Cypress frameworks are used for testing.

## Pre-Development Procedures
<code>explain process for user stories, brainstorm, system diagrams, interface, pitch??</code>

## Sprint Procedures
<code>Explain sprint planning??</code>

At the beginning of each sprint a sprint-specific branch (i.e. sprint3) and feature-specific branches (i.e. customTimeLimits) should be created. Throughout the sprint, all team members should work on the feature-specific branch corresponding to their assigned issue. Throughout the sprint, multiple pull requests should be made from the feature-specific branches to the sprint-specific branch. The final pull request from a feature-specific branch to a sprint-specific branch should close the issue(s) related to the feature.

At the end of each sprint, a pull request should be made from the sprint-specific branch to the master branch.

The primary team leader is responsible for reviewing all pull requests, resolving merge conflicts (or delegating resolution to other team members), and approving the pull requests.

ADRs should be updated as the team decides on design changes. Each change should be well-documented in an ADR markdown document titled located in [<code>./specs/adr</code>](./specs/adr).

## Installation
1. Clone the cse110-w21-group35
 repository onto your local machine using <pre>git clone `https://github.com/nidhigiridhar/cse110-w21-group35.git`</pre>

## Code style
The Dream Team uses a standard coding style, and a guide to Dream Team specific styling standards can be found [here](./source/style-guide.md).

## Documentation
All Javascript files should be well documented using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) standards.

Using GitHub Actions, all documentation should be generated and updated each time a sprint specific branch is merged with the master branch. The documentation for Productoro is hosted on [this repository](https://github.com/sywong888/cse110-w21-group35-docs/tree/gh-pages) (on the gh-pages branch) and deployed to [this page](https://sywong888.github.io/cse110-w21-group35-docs/).
