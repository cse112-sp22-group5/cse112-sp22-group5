## **2. Primary Means of Communication**
Our team will use Slack as the primary means of communication.  
Team members are expected to  
  * read and respond to messages within 12 hours
  * turn on Slack channel notifications

## **3. Scheduling Meetings**
Virtual team meetings will take place weekly on
  * Thursdays at 4-5 pm PT
  * Wednesday at 1-1:30 pm PT (with Chad Hayen)

Regarding meeting minutes agendas, agendas should be finalized and pushed to the team Github repository at least one hour before each meeting. Team members should Slack message the items they would like to be added to the agenda.

## **4. General Responsibilities for All Team Members**
Following each meeting, all team members must refer to the meeting minutes to review the items discussed and their to-do tasks. Those absent from the meetings should review the meeting minutes after they are linked in the #general Slack channel.

Team members should ensure they complete their assigned tasks by the deadline given by the team. If a team member cannot complete their task on time, for whatever reason, said team member should notify the team of the delay on Slack.

Overall, team members should be respectful, honest, and open-minded toward each. The team should always communicate openly with one another.

## **5. Conflict Resolution**
If a team member does not complete their assigned task by the designated deadline and does not notify the team of the delay, Nidhi and/or Sydney will reach out to the team member on Slack.

In the case of a disagreement regarding decision-making that arises during a meeting, each disagreeing party will explain their reasoning before the team. As a team, everyone will decide whether to vote on a decision, decide at a later date, or ask Chad for advice regarding which decision should be made.

In the case of a conflict between two or more team members that cannot be easily resolved, Nidhi and Sydney will be brought in to attempt to resolve the disagreement. If conflict persists, Chad will be asked to help moderate and resolve the conflict.
