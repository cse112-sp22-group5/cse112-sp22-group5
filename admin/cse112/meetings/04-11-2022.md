## Meeting Details

## Notes

- Evaluating Projects
	- Sanat will give out more details later
	- As a team, we need to establish a criteria based method to evaluate projects
		- Objective way to evaluate code, testing, build strategies, the website, how close execution was to goals, etc.
		- We still need some form of subjectivity
		- Need to create a slide deck of the criteria
		- DUE on Thurs (04/14)
			- Comments on slide deck on Friday (04/15)
		- Choose project by Tues (04/19)
	- Two phase evaluation (can do our own type of evaluation strategy as well, but have to give justification and reasoning)
		- First phase
			- List all the projects
			- Assign 1-2 projects to people who have not worked on them
				- Each person will give a rating from 1-5/10 to short list the top two projects
		- Second Phase
			- Deep dive on top 2 projects
			- Entire team will look at both projects and choose one

- Project has been chosen
	- 25-30%~ of the code base has to be retianed
		- Be careful of stripping more code than you need to rather than retaining more code than you need to
