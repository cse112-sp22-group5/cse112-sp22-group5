## Pending Business (from previous meeting):
 
## Notes, Decisions, Issues:
 * Unit tests
   * we can click on pull requests -> run tests to see the result of each test
 * Documentation
   * We can set up a GitHub action and API to automate documentation with html
 * Pair programming
   * our system of paired programming with different system fine
   * might make sense to eventually have two people simultaneously work on a class (and divide the work)
 * Styling
   * we should make sure the html works (before Javascript) that CSS people can get started
 * We need to decide who is writing documentation and when
 * Right now, testing basically includes unit tests
 * Branching by features sounds good
 * If we are going to make the timer fully automated, we need to have a good reason in our problem statement
