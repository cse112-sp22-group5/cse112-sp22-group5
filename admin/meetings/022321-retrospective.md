## Notes, Decisions, Issues:

- we discussed the major points that received the most points on Retrium
- testing & test driven development: write tests earlier and throughout development
  - in the future, we will assign multiple people to be on the testing team
  - tests/idea for tests should be written before implementation
- better utilizing the features on the project board
  - write more comments on issues
  - remember to link issues to pull requests
  - move the cards on the board
- integrate earlier
  - make pull requests more often (as something is finished)
  - Nidhi will review the pull requests and merge during the sprint
  - continue to use feature branches
- communication between teams
  - talk with other teams who are working on similar files before making a pull request
- standups
  - we will keep all the standups asynchronous
  - we are moving our weekly meeting from Thursdays to Tuesdays at 12:30 pm PST
  - in the future, everyone needs to turn on their slack notifications so that they get reminders about meetings
- push more frequently to the repo
  - everyone should push to the repo after every ~100 lines of code
- note: a lot of items discussed at the retrospective are on Retrium
- Here are some screenshots of Retrospective created on Retrium
