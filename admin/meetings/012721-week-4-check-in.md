## Notes, Decisions, Issues:

- Continue fleshing out user stories/persona
  - think about different types of students (college vs high school, research vs homework)
- Make sure focus is developing a pomodoro timer
  - Don't make task planner is not primary feature
  - Would a student actually input planner into app? Or keep track of this somewhere else?
  - Instead, group together pomos
- We need to have a good argument for why we are deciding to doa feature one way
- Customizability
  - app architecture will need to allow for customizable (will be more complicated)
