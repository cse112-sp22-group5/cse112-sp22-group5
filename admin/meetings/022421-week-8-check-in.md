## Pending Business (from previous meeting):

## Notes, Decisions, Issues:

- integration: the new method of frequently doing pull requests to sprint 3 branch sounds good
- documentation:
  - make sure to use the @name, etc. tags for jsdocs
- timer too slow problem:
  - try updating the interval every 500 or 250 ms instead of 1000 ms so that we're not skipping over a sec
  - in the updateTimer we can use integer division
- sprint 3 issues:
  - keyboard shortcuts: use S and R
  - delay after start is clicked is fixed
  - background color changes are halfway there (color is hard-coded right now)
- retrospective
  - our action items look good
  - Chad recommends trying a light version of TDD
- testing:
  - mash buttons (manual UI testing)
  - end the timer right as the countdown is about to end (race condition)

## TODOs:

## To discuss at next meeting:
