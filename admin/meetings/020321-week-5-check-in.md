## Notes, Decisions, Issues:

- Things to think about:
  - research how to do banner notifications
  - explicitly decide the relationship between tasks and timer (can you run timer without having tasks?)
  - think about whether progress bar is necessary
  - think about what to do with timer at the top of beyond MVP wireframe
    - possibly make tasks a retractable side bar
  - do pomodoros carry over from task to task?
- System diagrams:
  - C4:
    - container diagram - normally, sparse, could include libraries
    - component diagram - include descriptions, how components interact with each other (arrows)
  - create 1 or 2 UML diagrams for the main classes
- Pipeline:
  - assign 2/3 people to work on pipeline
- Tasks:
  - need to have reason to implement this
  - make sure it doesn't eat up development time and that users want it
- Create ADRs for tasks (who owns what, do pomodoros belong to task or vice versa) and breakdown of tasks from project roadmap
- Project pitch
  - role of tasks and timer
  - target audience - explicitly connect personas to features
  - will take place this weekend (~30 min)
