## **2. Primary Means of Communication**
Our team will use Slack as the primary means of communication.  
Team members are expected to  
  * read and respond to messages within 12 hours
  * turn on Slack notifications

## **3. Scheduling Meetings**
Zoom team meetings will take place weekly on
  * Thursdays at 4-5 pm PT
  * Wednesdays at 1-1:30 pm PT (with Chad)

The Thursday meetings are mandatory for all Dream Team members. If a team member plans to be absent from a meeting, they must notify Nidhi and Sydney at least 24 hours before the meetings.

Regarding meeting minutes agendas, agendas should be finalized and pushed to the team Github repository at least one hour before each meeting. Team members should Slack message the items they would like added to the agenda.

## **4. General Responsibilities for All Team Members**
Following each meeting, all team members must review the items discussed and their to-do tasks on the meeting minutes. Those absent from the meetings should review the meeting minutes after they are linked in the #general Slack channel.

All team members are responsible for continually updating the team on the progress of their assigned tasks and any bugs they are encountering. The exact method of recording these updates (i.e. Slack message, separate repository, daily stand-up) will be decided at a later date.

Team members should ensure they complete their assigned tasks by the deadline given by the team. If a team member cannot complete their task on time, for whatever reason, said team member should notify the team of the delay on Slack.

Overall, team members should be respectful, honest, and open-minded toward each other. The team should always communicate openly with one another.

## **5. Managerial Responsibilities**
The primary manager responsibilities include:  
  * Planning meeting times
  * Leading the team meetings
  * Being the first point of contact when other team members have questions or conflict
  * (more to be added as the project development continues)

The secondary manager responsibilities include:
  * Recording the meeting minutes
  * Being the second point of contact when the primary manager is unavailable or unreachable

## **6. Conflict Resolution**
If a team member does not complete their assigned task by the designated deadline and does not notify the team of the delay, Nidhi and/or Sydney will reach out to the team member on Slack.

In the case of a disagreement regarding decision-making that arises during a meeting, each disagreeing party will explain their reasoning before the team. As a team, everyone will decide whether to vote on a decision, decide at a later date, or ask Chad for advice regarding which decision should be made.

In the case of a conflict between two or more team members that cannot be easily resolved, Nidhi and Sydney will be brought in to attempt to resolve the disagreement. If the conflict persists, Chad will be asked to help moderate and resolve the conflict.
